# react portfolio
this portfolio showcases some of my most recent work and utilizes React for frontend development, HTML/CSS for styling, as well as a responsive contact form. React components were used to build the portfolio: header, footer, reactive body, and project components that are piped into the portfolio section. Backend MERN stack will be utilized to get the contact form working soon.
